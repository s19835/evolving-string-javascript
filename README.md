Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection, where the fittest individuals are chosen to reproduce, and their offspring inherit some characteristics from their parents. Over time, the population evolves, and solutions improve. These algorithms are useful in problems where traditional methods struggle, like complex optimization or search problems.

Key concepts include:
- Population: A set of potential solutions.
- Chromosome (Genome): Represents an individual in the population, usually a list or array of values.
- Fitness: A function that measures how good a solution is.
- Selection: The process of choosing individuals to reproduce based on fitness.
- Crossover: Combines two parent solutions to produce new offspring.
- Mutation: Introduces random changes to individuals to maintain diversity.

In JavaScript: Evolving a Simple String
Tries to evolve a random string to match a target string using a genetic algorithm.
